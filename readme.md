## 🧪 Developer Easter Eggs

You didn't hear this from us... but:

- The ⚙️ menu hides a **⨂ button**.
- Clicking it **4 times in 5 seconds** (in dark mode only) silently **summons the Overseer**.
- The Overseer is only visible in shadows... until you hover.
- It also sends a [POST request](https://api.vexrune.ai/overseer/ping) to an (imaginary?) API.
- And yes, there's a creepy console message too 👁️

Open your browser console and try it.  
We dare you.
